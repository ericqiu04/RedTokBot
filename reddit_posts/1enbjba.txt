Title: AITA for crying when my husband bought me a birthday cake, 
Text: I F(43) am celebrating my birthday today. My kids and husband M(39) stayed home to have lunch and celebrate. We have been married for almost 20 years and is safe to say he knows well what I like and don't like. While preparing breakfast, my husband went to get coffee and returned home with a small cake to sing Happy Birthday. When he pulled out the cake from the package, it was a chocolate German cake, his favorite, from a local pastry shop he had been craving to try for months. He also pulls out a small container with a slice of cheesecake, my favorite. He proudly announced he bought the cake as it was the only one available, and that he wanted to buy a whole cheesecake but they only had portions. So he thought it best to buy the entire one and bring me the slice since is the one I liked. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the gesture, the cake is for everyone to eat, but my face probably changed and he started asking me if I didn't like it. I told him I loved it as best I could, but couldn't help my eyes getting watery and tears streaming down after that. He started making faces and getting annoyed. I told him in front of my kids 15 and 12, that I didn't want him to feel like I was being ungrateful, however, I couldn't help to feel bad as it was his favorite cake and pastry shop, not something I liked. And not because I didn't like the flavor of the cake, is just the lack of thought behind the action. I think I wouldn't have felt as bad or reacted that way if he hadn't bought the cheesecake slice to confirm that is in fact what I like and he knows it. AITA?
