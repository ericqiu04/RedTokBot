Title: AITA for getting angry when gf wore one of my watches and criticised my spending habits?
Text: I am 22M, she’s 23F. I’ve been collecting high end watches for several years. It’s a hobby that I’m passionate abt, having invested lots of money into my collection. 2 days ago, we were at my apartment and I was in the bathroom. I came back to find her wearing one of my most expensive watches. She was on the couch and when she saw me all she asked was how it looks on her. I immediately got upset and angry and told her that she should’ve asked me before wearing it. She was somehow surprised? And asked why it was such a big deal. To be fair, she knows close to nothing about watches and especially this brand (PP). So I tried explaining to her how valuable and delicate it is and that i like it to be handled carefully. Then she got even more upset, questioning why I would spend that much money on a watch instead of investing it or saving it. She didnt know about my financial background to be able to afford this as we have only been dating for a month. She felt lied to, asking why I didn’t tell her this until now. Since then, there has been tension between us (irl and texting). I’m not sure what to think, AITA? Edit: some points people keep asking: I recently moved here from outside america - don’t have a safe, don’t have most of my watches with me The watches are on a shelf in my bedroom in their boxes/cases I was in the bathroom for 15 min to shower, she was in the kitchen when I left and the couch she was on is in the living room (which is connected to the kitchen) “Several years” = 3 years, English is not my first language
