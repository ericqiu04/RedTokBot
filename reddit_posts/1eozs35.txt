I 33m am I single father to my 10 month old baby. Their mom passed away after birth do to some complications. We were never a couple just best friends and platonic solemated. We lived together and everything but we not sexualy attracted to each other, I'm gay and agree was Ace. Couple of months back my regular group of friends added this new girl to the groups. Anna 27, I didn't much care for her but she tried coming on way too strong and flirting with me. I tried rejecting her nicely and even told her I'm gay. Last week I invited my friend over for dinner, I love to cook and bake, and she showed up. After seeing my kid she somehow became even worst. She wanted to hold them and tried to offer to baby sit for me. I took my kid away and sent him to my dad's place(lives next door to me) she would not drop it. After everyone had gone home she tried adding me on all social media and tried messaging me non stop. My last straw was wren she said and I quote "all kids need a mom and I'd be the perfect one for both of you, he already loves me" I snapped and told her she was insane and my kid only meet her once and does not even remember her face, that she will never be anything to us and that if my kid ever got another parent it would be a second dad. I then told her to check her delusional self and never talk to me again. I blocked her after that everywhere. Most of my friends are on my side but a few think I was too harsh to her. Edit to add Because it seems to have cause some confusion I'll explain here. Me and my friend were never sexual. We have/had known each other for 20 years and the only people that still think we were a couple are her grandparents who are just old and don't remember stuff half the time but love their great grandkid like crazy. We both have always wanted to be parents and decided to go for it with the help of doctors via Artificial insemination...
