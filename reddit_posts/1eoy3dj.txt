Title: AITA for telling my brother and his husband they can’t raise their baby in my home?
Text: I (34F) have always been clear about my decision not to have children. I love my life as it is, quiet, organized, and free of the responsibilities that come with parenting. I own a decent home, and I have been very particular about maintaining a calm, adult-friendly environment. My brother (30M) and his husband (32M) recently adopted a baby, which is great news for them, but it’s where the issue starts. They live in a small apartment and asked if they could move in with me for about a year while they save up to buy a bigger place. They said it would be a huge help for them financially, and they assumed I’d be supportive because we’re close. But I don’t want a baby in my house. I have worked hard to build a child-free life that I am happy with, and having a baby here would completely disrupt that. When they asked, I told them no, explaining that I don’t want the noise, mess, or disruption of a baby in my home. I suggested they look into other options, like moving to a more affordable apartment or seeking help from his husband’s family, who live in the same city. My brother was shocked and said I was being selfish and that family should help each other out, especially in times of need. Now my parents are involved, and they think I’m being unreasonable and cold-hearted. They say that this is a critical time for my brother and that I should be more supportive. My brother hasn’t spoken to me since I turned them down, and I’m being painted as the villain of the family. I’m sticking to my decision because I know I wouldn’t be happy with a baby in the house, but now I’m wondering if I’m being too rigid. AITA for refusing to let my brother and his husband raise their baby in my home?
