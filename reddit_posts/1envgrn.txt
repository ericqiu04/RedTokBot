Title: AITA for not coming back home after being kicked out?
Text: I have been the foundation for my first generation immigrant family for as long as I can remember - cleaning the house, cooking, raising my younger siblings, dispersing fights, managing my parent's affair, making doctor appointments, filing all of my family's taxes, you name it. I took a trip with an old friend (I funded it 100%) to get away and clear my head for a week and when I came back home, my mom kicked me out. She says I am becoming too "uncontrollable" because I made an "adult choice" and I should know my place as a child. I told her I am only a child when it's convenient for her and am an adult otherwise throughout my whole entire life because of the positions she forced me into. She gave me two days to pack my belongings knowing I was a full time college student, had just quit my job at a horrible short-staffed, low pay work environment and was waiting on a background check to clear at my new job at a bank. The transmission on my car was messed up and I had a straight $500 left in my savings. She was aware of all this and still pushed me out. Now, she won't stop calling my phone and leaving voicemails of her sobbing for me to come back. As much as I miss the comfort of having a home (although I had to pay rent), I cannot bring myself to fully have that daughter-mother connection which we used to have. Because even despite the circumstances, I still loved my mother and her flaws knowing my father had inflicted so much abuse onto her and in return, she had become not all there. My question is, AITA for not returning home although it seems as if she really regrets her actions? I am torn, I still love her but wonder why she always treated me so horribly growing up.
