Title: AITA Monthly Open Forum August 2024: Remembering Assholes
Text: # Keep things civil. Rules still apply. Let’s do a little spin on our “tell us about a time you were the asshole” deal from a couple of months back. But this time, let’s remember the assholes we’ve lost. I mean that in the best way possible. To be clear, this is not intended to be a “let’s shit on the dead” type of thing. If you want to rant and rave about someone whose grave you’d rather piss on, I’m sure there’s a sub for that. What we’d like to see here is something about an asshole in your life that you’ve lost. But, you think back on them fondly and smile. Even when thinking about some of their asshole ways. I know I certainly have someone like that. And I do miss them. Even with their assholery, I’d much rather have them here. So, tell us about that asshole that’s moved on. As we've done in the past, some sub rules can be relaxed a little. For example, it’s OK if your tale involves a relationship. But, we still cannot host anything that mentions violence. ___ # As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.
