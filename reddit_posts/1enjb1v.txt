Title: AITA for hosting a family friendly BBQ that didn't welcome certain "family members"
Text: My wife and I finally bought our first house after 10+ years in an apartment. I hosted a housewarming BBQ for friends and family. My wife is 5 months pregnant so we weren't about to have a rager. She wants to not be pregnant when we host one of those. For this party though, we told everyone that this would be a family friendly party. All ages were welcome. The day of the BBQ, our guests started showing up. For a bit, I was running around with my head cut off and so it took me a while to actually greet everyone. During this time, my wife came and got me and told me that my buddy Dave brought their dog. My wife does not like dogs. I go to Dave and his wife, greet them and then I ask why he brought his dog. He cited the family friendly party and the dog is literally his family. I was told by my wife I just stared at him for a good 10 seconds. I was processing what he said because I found it a bit crazy. I told him what I meant by family, was to bring your human family. I told him it was incredibly rude to assume my house and yard was pet friendly. So I told him to take the dog home and come back. He got pissed at me and told me that I needed to specify that some family members were excluded. I called him crazy for thinking that. He said it was a shame that I was being an asshole because my backyard is great for a dog. He left and didn't come back. My friends told me it was unnecessary to kick him out. I didn't kick him out, i kicked the dog out. They said the dog is super friendly and well trained and wasn't bothering anyone. I told everyone I don't care if its the best dog in the world, its not welcome. AITA?
