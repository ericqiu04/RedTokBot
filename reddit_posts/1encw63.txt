Title: WIBTA if I don’t let my best friend walk with her boyfriend at my wedding?
Text: 24F at getting married next spring. My best friend from childhood is one of my bridesmaids. She is 22. We’ve always been close even though we aren’t very alike. She’s always been sheltered and is pretty religious. About 5 months ago she got her first real boyfriend. She is very into him and believes they will get married. They might actually because he’s also pretty religious and sheltered. I know for a fact that their first time having sex was with eachother. You know how the bridal parties enter the ceremony 2 by 2 and then have introductions during the reception? Here’s the issue: my best friend told me that she thinks it’s disrespectful of her and me as well if she walks down the aisle or enters the reception with a groomsman (or “another man” as she puts it). She thinks that it would be respectful of her relationship if her boyfriend walks with her for these 2 parts. To be clear, she is NOT suggesting her boyfriend be in the wedding party. She just wants to walk down with him then he will go sit in his normal spot. I think this is a weird request and I would like to say no. It would just make thing look awkward. I don’t think she would decline to be a part if I say no but she will be upset and say I’m not respecting her relationship. Before yall say maybe it’s him putting her up to it, I don’t think so. This is so something I can see coming from her but I don’t know maybe it is him.
