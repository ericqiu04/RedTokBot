I’m 26 and living at home with my mom and her husband. Things work pretty well for us.

One thing that bothers me is that my mom will come into my room to put my mail on my dresser, bed, or sometimes my pillow. It bothers me that she won’t just give me a chance to collect my mail myself and I especially dislike the idea of anything other than my head being put on my pillow.

I recently asked my mom to just leave my mail with hers, near our front door. She agreed to do so.

Today, however, I noticed that she just put a bunch of books on my already overpacked bookshelf, just a day after she agreed to stop coming in here. I asked her why she did this and she just said “I needed to put my books on our shelf,” even though there are already books piled to the ceiling in my room and half of them are hers.

Am I the asshole to ask her (for a second time) to stop coming in here? I’m 26 and living at home— I just want a little bit of privacy.
