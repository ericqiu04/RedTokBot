Every gosh darn time I ask my husband ANYTHING he can NEVER just answer, let alone be honest. EVERY damn time he is wrong he can NEVER say he was wrong or even apologize. He is the type to rear-end someone and then say it wasn't him, it was car! ðŸ˜¤ I just CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE. 

What made me come here was shear DESPERATION. I can't handle it. He smokes weed all day long and tapes. His memory is HORRIBLE and is a habitual liar. I've been smelling cigarette smoke every time he comes back in. So I asked him, 
ME:
"have you been smoking cigarettes again?" HIM: 
 "what, no, no I haven't, I SWEAR TO GOD"
ME:
 "There's no way, I know what I smell, your smoking cigarettes again or mixing it in your weed" (He use to do this all the time and stopped bc he quit smoking)
HIM:
 "Well yeah I'm breaking them up and mixing it in my weed"
ME:
 "That's F-ing SMOKING CIGARETTES!! What do you do after you mix your weed and cigarette together? You go outside and.......YOU SMOKE IT!"
HIM:
 BLOWS UP, YELLS, I MEAN YELLS, CUSSES, ETC
ME:
 "I am so sick of your semantics and manipulation, it's sick! I'm over it! Trust me buddy, you don't want to play semantics with me!"
HIM:
 "MORE CUSSING, semantics, it's not semantics. I'm not fucking smoking cigarettes, more YELLING AND CUSSING"

This is just the most recent example. ITS ALL THE DAMN TIME. His main complaint is my nagging. Which I guess asking questions is nagging to him, which is fine. But he ALWAYS thinks he is right. He will swear to God, look me dead in the eyes, promise, etc all while lying right to my face. He doesn't understand that my "nagging" probably would be none existent if HE WAS HONEST AND NOT A MANIPULATIVE BELIGERENT SEMANTIC PLAYING JERK UNABLE TO EVER BE HUMBLE, HONEST AND WRONG!! UGHHHHHHH ðŸ˜  ðŸ˜¡ ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜£ 

I feel so so empty and lonely and insecure bc I'm not even worth or respected enough to deserve the truth and honesty. The sad thing is, it's some of the things he will lie about are HUGE and some are ridiculous and stupid ðŸ¤¦ 
I am going crazy ðŸ¤ª  and just need a little guidance. SOMEBODY, ANYBODY.........AITA?
