 Now, you may have noticed I am married to a very strong and talented woman. Michelle is not afraid to speak her mind or tell me when I'm wrong, which happens frequently. And we have two beautiful daughters. So I'm surrounded by smart, strong women. And in raising our girls, we've tried to instill in them basic value.
