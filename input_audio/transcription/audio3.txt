 Every person has the right to practice their faith, how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Neha, for what a wonderful introduction. Everybody, please have a seat. Nothing fills me with more hope than when I hear incredible young people like Neha and all the outstanding work that she's doing on behalf of.
